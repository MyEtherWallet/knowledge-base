# **Why are Random Tokens Appearing in my Wallet?**

Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been 'airdropping' tokens in the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.

The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ether (ETH) you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.

That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find more information about airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet for more information.

#### _If an airdrop website is asking for your private key, it's a scam and they are trying to steal your funds._
