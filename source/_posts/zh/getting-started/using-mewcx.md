# **MEW CX User Guide**

## MEW CX allows users to have the entirety of MEW in a bite-sized Chrome Extension accessible from their toolbar.

<br>

Create and manage your wallets, interact with Dapps, and send transactions quick using our QuickSend feature.

## **Installing MEW CX**

**Step 1.** On Google Chrome, head to [the download page for MEW CX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-extension/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en). Then select ‘Add to Chrome’.

-   To avoid downloading a fake client, double-check the provider for MyEtherWallet Inc, and check the rating / number of users.

-   Google Chrome will require you to accept permissions. Read our article for [more information about what permissions are required](https://www.howtogeek.com/291095/why-do-chrome-extensions-need-all-your-data-on-the-websites-you-visit/). Rest assured that MEW will never store or share any of your data. This permission is necessary for checking URLs for known phishing sites, or interacting with a DApp on another website.

**Step 2.** After you’ve installed MEW CX, click the MEW icon in your toolbar. A pop-up will appear asking you to add a wallet. Click there.

**Step 3.** Choose how you’d like to access your wallet, or generate a new one. And you’re done!

-   Check out our guide on [access methods](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/) for more information on the subject.

Your wallet will remain saved in the Chrome Extension until you remove the wallet or the extension. Remember, it’s always best to keep your wallet information on physical paper somewhere safe and easy to remember, in case anything happens to your device.

## **Using MEW CX**

MEW CX can be used to interact with various Dapps all across the cryptosphere. Check out our Dapps page a full record of Dapps that work with MEW CX!

When you're ready to interact with a Dapp, you can choose which wallet you'd like to use for communicating with the Dapps interface.

You can also create a 'burner account' for temporary access to Dapps, like browsing around the site.
