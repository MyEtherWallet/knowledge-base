## **Not Recommended:**

<br>

#### These are **not** recommended ways to create and access your wallet.

#### We highly suggest you [access MEW offline](/@@@@@@/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/) when using these options.

## **Before we continue, a few words of caution:**

-   Never share this information with anyone. This information gives complete and permanent access to your wallet.
-   Do not keep this information on a device connected to the internet. Hackers can and will find it in your hard drive.
-   Choose strong passwords and write everything down, in multiple locations.
-   We cannot recover this information for you.

## **Keystore/JSON**

#### _Read more about what a Keystore/JSON file is [here](/@@@@@@/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/)._

**Step 1.** Head to [www.myetherwallet.com](http://www.myetherwallet.com).

**Step 2.** Click ‘Create a New Wallet’.

**Step 3.** Choose the ‘By JSON File’ option.

**Step 4.** Enter a **_strong_** password, and write it down on paper.

-   We cannot recover or reset your password for you. Write it down!

**Step 5.** Download your JSON File, preferably to a USB device.

-   Do not open this file. It is meant to be used by our interface.

**Step 6.** Now you’re done, and ready to access your wallet!

## **Mnemonic Phrase**

#### _Read more about what a Mnemonic Phrase is [here](/@@@@@@/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/)._

**Step 1.** Head to [www.myetherwallet.com](http://www.myetherwallet.com).

**Step 2.** Click ‘Create a New Wallet’.

**Step 3.** Choose the ‘By Mnemonic Phrase’ option.

**Step 4.** Choose a 12 or 24 word phrase, and WRITE IT DOWN!

-   Do not store this on your computer. It is meant to be written down multiple times.

**Step 5.** There is an option for an extra word here, for added security. Choosing to include an extra word keeps your phrase more secure, but it limits the accessibility of your phrase with other wallets. Other wallets may not allow for an extra word, making your phrase incompatible.

-   We cannot recover or reset your phrase or extra word for you. Write it down!

**Step 6.** Now pass a quick test, and you’re done! You’re ready to access your wallet.
