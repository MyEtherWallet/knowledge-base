## **UPDATE: The MEWconnect app has been discontinued to make way for our fully-fledged MEW wallet app, which allows users to store ETH and tokens, send transactions, and swap directly from their phone!**

#### **[Download the MEW wallet app now][downloadmewwallet] for iOS or Android and migrate your account for free!**

## \*\* **This article is outdated** \*\*

## **1. Create a Wallet**

**Step 1.** Open your MEWconnect app.

**Step 2.** Click "Create New Wallet".

**Step 3.** Pick a strong password.

This step is very important. Make sure you pick a password that is not easy to guess, but also write it down with pen and paper. There is only one other way to access your wallet, and we’ll get to that soon.

**Step 4.** Type it again.

**Step 5.** Click "Start using MEWconnect".

You’re done! You’ll be taken to a screen that shows your new wallets address backed by a unique color-code. On this screen you’ll find all your ETH and ERC20 tokens that we support in our default list. Custom tokens can only be seen using our web interface.

## **2. Back it up**

**Step 1.** Select "Back Up" on your wallets homepage.

**Step 2.** Click "Back Up Now".

**Step 3.** Get a pen and paper ready. Then press ‘Start’.

**Step 4.** Enter in your password to verify you’re you.

**Step 5.** WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED WORDS.

This is the single most important piece of information about your wallet. These 24 words will decide the future of your funds. Do not lose them, write them down!

**Step 6.**  Pass the seed word check test.

You're done! All backed up and ready to connect to MEW

**Step 1.** Unlock your wallet on MEWconnect.

**Step 2.** Find a desktop computer. Head to the [MEW][mew] site.

Check for the SSL certification that states ‘MyEtherWallet Inc [US]’ in   the URL. We recommend the Google Chrome browser.

**Step 4.** Click ‘MEWconnect’ as the method of access.

**Step 5.** On the app, click ‘Scan to Connect’.

## **How to Change Your Password on MEWconnect**

#### **You may want to consider upgrading to the [MEW wallet app][downloadmewwallet] instead of changing your password, as the MEWconnect app has been discontinued.**

<br>

To change your password on MEWconnect, all you need is your phone and your 24-word recovery phrase.

If you still remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, please scroll up to Section 2 of this article. Resetting your wallet without knowing your recovery phrase will result in the permanent loss of your wallet.

If you do not remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, there is nothing we can do. Retrace your steps and try to remember your password, or your wallet will be lost forever.

## **Change Your Password**

**Step 1.** Reset your wallet, either on the login screen or under our ‘Info’ section.

-   Choose ‘Forgot password?’ on the home screen, or ‘Reset wallet >’ in the Info tab.

**Step 2.** Enter your 24-word recovery phrase. Make sure each word is in the correct order and spelled accurately.

-   Do not include commas between the words, only a single space.

**Step 3.** Enter a new password. Please choose a difficult one, for increased security.

-   Be sure to write this password down somewhere, so you don’t forget it!
-   We cannot recover or change your password for you.

**Step 4.** Celebrate, you’re done!
