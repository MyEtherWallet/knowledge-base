# **The MEWconnect app has been removed from iOS and Android app stores**

### **The MEWconnect app has been removed from the iOS Apple Store and Android Google Play store as of August 13th, 2020.**

<br>

#### **Any users who still have MEWconnect on their phones are suggested to upgrade to the MEW wallet app, as MEWconnect will no longer be receiving updates.**

<br>

MyEtherWallet (MEW) has released [**the MEW wallet app**](https://mewwallet.myetherwallet.com), which offers increased functionality and top-of-the-line security while keeping all of the connectivity features of MEWconnect. The MEW wallet app allows users to send transactions and swap crypto directly in the app, while maintaining the MEWconnect protocol for connection to MEW web. Check out our article on [the similarities and differences between MEW wallet and MEWconnect](/@@@@@@/mewwallet/mewwallet-vs-mewconnect/).

The MEW wallet app is available now for both iOS and Android mobile devices.

## **Migrate from MEWconnect to the MEW wallet app:**

<br>

**Step 1.** Make sure you’ve backed up your MEWconnect account by writing down your 24 word recovery phrase.

-   You can find this phrase in MEWconnect by clicking on the small “i” icon in the top-left corner of the app, then selecting ‘View my recovery phrase’.

**Step 2.** Download the MEW wallet app from [the Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mew-wallet-ethereum-wallet/id1464614025) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myetherwallet.mewwallet&hl=en_US), depending on your device.

-   You can also find the app by clicking the ‘FREE UPGRADE’ button in the MEWconnect app.

**Step 3.** Open the MEW wallet app and click ‘Create a free wallet’. Since you have MEWconnect installed, it will ask if you wish to import your existing account over. Click ‘Import’.

</div>

**Step 4.** Enter the password you use for MEWconnect, then select ‘Import’ again. You’ll be asked to create a PIN. This is similar to the password used for MEWconnect, but you won’t need to use it often if you enable biometric authentication (such as a Fingerprint or FaceID).

-   Make sure you remember this PIN, as we cannot recover it for you.

**Step 5.** MEW wallet will now ask if you want to enable Biometric Authentication, such as Face ID. After you accept or skip, it will finish importing your MEWconnect account.
