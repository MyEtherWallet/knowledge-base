# **Open a Multi-Collateral Vault with MakerDAO**

###### If you’d like to open a Vault using our MakerDAO Dapp, you will need a wallet you can [access with our interface](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/). If you do not have one yet, check out our guide on [how to set up a new wallet](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/).

## **Opening Your Vault**

**Step 1.** Unlock your wallet on our site by selecting ‘Access My Wallet’, then choosing the method of access you prefer.

**Step 2.** Head to our Dapps section to the left of your Wallet Overview page, then select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 3.** Select 'Create a Vault' to get started.

**Step 4.** Set the amount of ETH you would like to offer as collateral. Remember to leave some wiggle room to account for the shifting markets. 200% and above is usually a safe bet.

-   Before you generate your vault, you'll need to select 'Create Proxy'.
-   Make sure to confirm the transactions on your device, if you're using one.

## **Earning Interest With DAI**

**Step 1.** Head to the MakerDAO Dapp page and select 'DAI Savings'.

**Step 2.** Choose 'Set' to set allowance for Maker to interact with your DAI.

-   You will need to 'Deploy Proxy' if it's your first time. Select 'Setup' in the top area of this section.

**Step 3.** Choose how much DAI you'd like to deposit. Interest rates are accrued annually.

**Step 4.** To withdraw, you can follow the same procedure, but select 'Withdraw'.

## **Closing Your Vault**

**Step 1.** When you’re ready, head back to the Dapps section and select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 2.** Click ‘Manage Your Vault’ to see your holdings.

**Step 3.** You will need to pay your DAI back in order to withdraw your ETH. Under 'DAI Position', select 'Pay back >'.

-   You will have to ‘Approve’ the DAI amount in order to pay it back, which will count as a separate transaction.
-   Please wait for both transactions to post as 'Success' before continuing.

**Step 4.** Once approved and paid back, you can withdraw your ETH. Under 'ETH Collateral', select 'Withdraw >'.

**Step 5.** Your vault doesn't actually _close_, but remains empty and ready should you ever need to use it again.
