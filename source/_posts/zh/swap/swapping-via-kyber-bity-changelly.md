Here at MyEtherWallet (MEW), we’re all about fostering a seamless user experience, built on a foundation of security. This is why we’ve partnered with multiple exchanges, such as Bity, Kyber Network, and Changelly, to bring you competitive price points for your swaps.

To utilize our swap feature, first you must [access your wallet](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet).

In the wallet overview area of your account, you’ll see a ‘Swap’ option to the left. Click there to be redirected to our exchanging interface.

Choose the cryptocurrency you’d like to swap, and the second list will auto-populate with the choices we offer for that swap. The bottom of our interface will show which exchange is offering this price point, compared to other exchanges.

If all the information looks correct to you, simply enter the address you’d like to send the new funds to (feel free to use the same address as the one you’re sending from!) and press ‘Continue’.

A timer of 10 minutes will begin for you to review all your information, confirm the details, and send the transaction.

If you have issues with your swap, please reach out to the relevant exchange’s support team. Their emails are as follows:

-   Bity - Their help center is integrated into their site.
-   Kyber Network - [support@kyber.network](mailto:support@kyber.network)
-   Changelly - [support@changelly.com](mailto:support@changelly.com)
