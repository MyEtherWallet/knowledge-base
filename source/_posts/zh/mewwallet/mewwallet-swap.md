## We've partnered with DEX.AG to build a decentralized swap right in the MEW wallet app, allowing users to exchange their ETH and tokens without leaving their phone.

**To access the MEW wallet swap, you'll first need to [create a MEW wallet account][Mwcreate].**

<br>

**Step 1.** Open the MEW wallet app.

**Step 3.** When you're ready to begin, click 'Swap Tokens' in the top-left corner. Select the cryptos you'd like to swap and the amount you're offering, then click 'Find best rate'.

**Step 4.** DEX.AG will list multiple exchanges that offer competitive rates. Choose the rate that works best for you, then select 'Proceed with swap'. Make sure you review the details of your swap before continuing.
