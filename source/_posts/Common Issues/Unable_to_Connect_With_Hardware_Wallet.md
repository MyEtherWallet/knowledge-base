## <p align="Center">Unable to Connect to Hardware Wallet</p>
***

Most issues with connection can be solved by following these troubleshooting tips:

* Restart your computer. (Don’t be lazy, restart it first!)
* Use Google Chrome and perform a hard refresh (CTRL+F5 or Command+F5).
* Make sure you don’t have any other applications open that may be using your hardware wallet, i.e. Ledger Live for Ledger. (This opens automatically).
* Try a different USB cable.
* Make sure all your firmware is updated to its most recent version. 

If none of these options work, email us at support@myetherwallet.com. Please include as much information about your process as possible.
