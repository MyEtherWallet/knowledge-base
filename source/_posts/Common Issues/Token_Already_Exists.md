A 'Token Already Exists' error can occur when an incorrect contract address was added as a custom token. 

To find the correct contract address, follow these instructions:

**Step 2.** Use the contract address (not the creator address) for the custom token field in MEW. Be sure to use the correct decimal count as well.

### <p align="center">Other causes:</p>

This error can also occur if the symbol of your token is the same as a symbol already in our default list. To solve this, try adding the symbol with a '2' after. 

Using our above example, instead of 'SNT', you would add the token as 'SNT2'.

This has no actual effect on the token itself, but is just a placeholder to make organizing your tokens easier.
