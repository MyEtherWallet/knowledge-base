## **1. Create a Wallet**

**Step 1.** Open your MEWconnect app.

**Step 2.** Click "Create New Wallet".

**Step 3.** Pick a strong password.

This step is very important. Make sure you pick a password that is not easy to guess, but also write it down with pen and paper. There is only one other way to access your wallet, and we’ll get to that soon.

**Step 4.** Type it again.

**Step 5.** Click "Start using MEWconnect".

You’re done! You’ll be taken to a screen that shows your new wallets address backed by a unique color-code. On this screen you’ll find all your ETH and ERC20 tokens that we support in our default list. Custom tokens can only be seen using our web interface.
