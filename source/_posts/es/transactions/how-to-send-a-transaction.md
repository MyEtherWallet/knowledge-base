# **How to Send a Transaction**

MyEtherWallet (MEW) makes it easy for you to send a transaction. All you need is a wallet, the Ethereum address you’d like to send funds to, and a little ETH for gas.

**All transactions require ETH for gas. We suggest having at least .01 ETH for 2 - 3 transactions. Read more about gas [here](/@@@@@@/transactions/what-is-gas/).**

If you plan to move large amounts of ETH or ERC20 tokens, we suggest sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes as planned.

**Step 1.** [Access your wallet](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/).

**Step 2.** Select the button that says 'Send Transaction', or find this section in the 'Send' category from the left menu.

**Step 3.** Fill in the type of currency you’d like to send, the amount, and the address you’d like to send to.

-   Make sure to double and triple check the address you’re sending to! We cannot recover funds sent to the wrong address.
-   When sending your entire balance of ETH, choose the ‘Send Entire Balance’ option, so your gas is auto-calculated out of the total.
-   Gas and gas limit will auto-generate based on network congestion.
-   If you don’t see the token you’d like to send, you may need to [add it as a custom token](/@@@@@@/tokens/how-to-add-custom-token/).

**Step 4.** Click ‘Send Transaction’ and confirm the transaction on the next screen.

-   If you’re using MEWconnect or a hardware wallet, be sure to confirm the transaction on your device as well.

**Step 5.** Your transaction has been posted! Copy your transaction hash, for your records.

-   Check your transaction hash on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) to make sure everything went through properly.
