## **Most issues with connection can be solved by following these troubleshooting tips:**

-   Restart your computer. (Don’t be lazy, restart it first!)
-   Use Google Chrome and perform a hard refresh (CTRL+F5 or Command+F5).
-   Make sure you don’t have any other applications open that may be using your hardware wallet, i.e. Ledger Live for Ledger. (This opens automatically).
-   Try a different USB cable.
-   Make sure all your firmware is updated to its most recent version.

If none of these options work, email us at [support@myetherwallet.com.](mailto:support@myetherwallet.com.) Please include as much information about your process as possible.
