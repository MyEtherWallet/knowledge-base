# **Using a CoolWallet Hardware Wallet with MEW**

CoolWallet Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their sleek design, uncompromising security, and bluetooth capabilities. They are available for purchase [here](https://www.coolwallet.io/product/coolwallet/).

_Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure._

Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW).

**This part is very important.** Your CoolWallet device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.

Without further ado, let’s begin!

## **The Initial Set-Up**

**Step 1.** Unbox your CoolWallet! Pull out your phone, make sure Bluetooth is turned on, and download the CoolWallet Mobile App, CoolBitX, by scanning the QR code from the CoolWallet tutorial, included with your device.

**Step 2.** Turn on your device by pressing and holding the main button. You will be asked to pair your device. Open the mobile app to  connect the device.

-   If you don't see it, try restarting the device, the app, or turning your bluetooth on and off again.

**Step 3.** Enter the pin you see on your CoolWallet device into the app, then press the button on your device. This will complete the pairing process. After you're done, you can click 'Create' to create your wallet.

**Step 4.** This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need this recovery phrase. The app lets you select a length of phrase, this is your choice. Do not write this recovery phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your recovery phrase in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this phrase, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.

-   There is paper provided in the CoolWallet set-up box to write down this phrase.
-   CoolWallet gives their recovery phrase in numeric format instead of traditional words. For more information on why, [check out their answer](https://help.coolwallet.io/article/73-why-is-the-seed-generated-from-coolwallet-s-in-numeric-format). We recommend copying both the numbers and their word equivalents, just in case.
-   After you're done, you'll need to add up all the numbers in your phrase to verify it was written correctly.

**Step 5.** Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.

## **Using CoolWallet with MEW**

**Step 1.** In the CoolWallet mobile app, go into your settings and make sure you are allowing new pairings. Then head to our site, [www.myetherwallet.com](http://www.myetherwallet.com).

**Step 2.** On MEW, select 'Access My Wallet' > 'Hardware' > 'CoolWallet'. It should ask for a pairing password.

-   Make sure the bluetooth on your computer is also turned on. You may need to manually pair it with your computer the first time you use it. This can be done with a pairing password generated from the CoolWallet device.

**Step 3.** On your CoolWallet mobile app, select 'Show Pairing Password'. This will generate a password to pair with MEW. Type this password in then close your app before continuing. Once you're done, select 'Unlock CoolWallet'.

**Step 4.** You will see a bunch of addresses here. Feel free to choose your address.

-   There's no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it's up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory's sake.

**Step 5.**  You should now be taken to a screen that shows your CoolWallet public address. Great job! You’re officially using your new CoolWallet hardware wallet!

## **What About My Old Wallet???**

If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure CoolWallet address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the CoolWallet). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new CoolWallet address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.

Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.

## **How Do I Restore My CoolWallet to a New Device?**

You will need to use your recovery phrase to recover your wallet.

## **Troubleshooting**

Most issues with the CoolWallet can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and turning Bluetooth on and off again.
