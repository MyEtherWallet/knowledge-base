## **1. Check the URL to make sure it says ‘MyEtherWallet.com’.**

-   Keep us bookmarked for future use.
-   Phishers are tricky, so make sure there are no dots or accents on any of the letters.
-   If you find a phishing site, send it to us so we can take it down!
-   Download [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn), [PhishFort](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc), or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige) for up-to-date alerts when visiting known phishing sites.

## **2. Use the checksummed version of your address.**

-   This is the version of your address that includes both capital and lowercase letters.
-   For more information on checksummed addresses, click [here](/@@@@@@/common-issues/not-checksummed/).

## **3. Send a small amount first, to test the waters.**

-   We cannot reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Make sure you know the process inside and out!
-   Learn more about sending transactions [here](/@@@@@@/transactions/how-to-send-a-transaction/).

## **4. Keep your information off the computer.**

-   Write down everything in physical backups.
-   Pen and paper is highly underrated. No one can hack your notebook!
-   However, you can lose your notebook – so make extra copies.
-   [Use MEW offline](/@@@@@@/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/) for extra security!

## **5. Do not share your private information with anyone.**

-   Including us! We will never ask for your private key.

## **6. We will never email you first.**

-   If you got an email from us without emailing us first, it’s not us.

## **7. Google can be your best friend or your worst enemy.**

-   Do your research, and remain skeptical!
-   Before sending to a third-party or using a new service, Google the service name + ‘scam’ or ‘reviews’.

## **8. Pay very close attention to address entry.**

-   Sending to a wrong address can mean the permanent loss of your funds. Make sure you know who you’re sending to.
-   Double and triple check everything. Even one wrong character will make a difference and lead to loss of funds.
-   Never hand type anything. Copy & paste is your best friend!

## **9. Buy a hardware wallet.**

-   Hardware wallets are generally around ~100 USD and offer the best protection for your crypto assets. So mathematically, if you have more than 200 USD in crypto, there is no excuse not to get one!
-   [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/?offer_id=12&aff_id=2029) are two great options we highly recommend!

## **10. Ask for help.**

-   This is still a very new field, but it has a strong community to back it up.
-   Social media platforms like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/myetherwallet) are filled with real people who live and breathe crypto, ourselves included!
-   Reach out to our support team directly if you’re ever confused or have concerns. We can be reached at [support@myetherwallet.com](mailto:support@myetherwallet.com).
