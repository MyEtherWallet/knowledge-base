Mist files are typically found in the file locations below, but it's much easier to open Mist, select "Accounts" in the top bar, select "Backup", and select "Accounts". This will open the folder where your files are stored.

-   Mac: `~/Library/Ethereum/keystore`
-   Linux: `~/.ethereum/keystore`
-   Windows: `%APPDATA%/Ethereum/keystore`
