## **As of October 20th, 2019 we have discontinued our VintageMEW site.**

<br>

If you are like many of our other users, you may be wondering how this will affect your wallet.

Fear not! MyEtherWallet (MEW) is still going strong at our current site, [www.myetherwallet.com](www.myetherwallet.com).

Here you are able to access the same wallet you used on the Vintage version of our site, through the same method.

You do not need to create a new wallet to use the new MEW site, you can use the exact same wallet you had on Vintage.-

**First, select ‘Access My Wallet’ on the homepage.**

**Then choose your usual method of access.** For example, if you used a Keystore/JSON file on vintage you’d select ‘Software’ and choose the ‘Keystore’ option to connect.

**After you’ve connected, you’ll be taken to your Wallet Dashboard page.** Here you can view your balances, send transactions, interact with Dapps, swap your crypto, and even manage NFTs!

We’ve come a long way since our days in Vintage, so it’s a good idea to take a few minutes and explore our new features.
