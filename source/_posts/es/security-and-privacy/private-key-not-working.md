Be sure there is not a space at the beginning or end of your private key. We validate based on the number of characters. A private key has 64 characters, count to make sure you have all 64. If you saved another version (i.e. the UTC / Keystore file) it may also be worth trying that file as well. For more information about how to use a Keystore file, learn how to [access your wallet](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/).

Please be sure that you are **carefully and accurately** typing your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than is yours.

For reference private key looks like this: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`
