# __Using MakerDAO__

###### If you’d like to open a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) using our MakerDAO Dapp, you will need a wallet you can access with our [interface][access]. If you do not have a wallet, [click here][create] to set one up. 

## __Opening Your CDP__

**Step 1.** Unlock your wallet on our site by selecting ‘Access My Wallet’, then choosing the method of access you prefer.

**Step 2.** Head to our Dapps section to the left of your Wallet Overview page, then select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 3.** Set the amount of ETH you would like to offer as collateral. Remember to leave some wiggle room to account for the shifting markets.
* You will need to confirm the transaction on your device, if you're using one.

**Step 3.** Depending on the amount of time you held your CDP open, a respective amount of MKR will have accrued at a 16.499% / year interest rate. 
* You will have to ‘Approve’ both MKR and DAI amounts in order to close the CDP.
* MKR can be swapped with ETH through our swap page.

* Please allow for both transactions to post as 'Success' before continuing.
