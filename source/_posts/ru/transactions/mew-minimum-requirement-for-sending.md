There is no minimum to transfer out of MyEtherWallet (MEW). We are not an exchange and have no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.

The only 'minimum' requirement is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is `0.000441 ETH`.

If you have `0.000X ETH` in your account and want to empty your account completely, send `0.01 ETH` into the account and use the "Send Entire Balance" button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of `0 ETH`.
