The MEWconnect Protocol is our wallet connection method involving the act of scanning a QR code to connect the MEW wallet app to a DApp or website. MEWconnect uses no centralized server for connection, so all access remains secure and decentralized.

MEW has built this protocol to make it easier than ever for users to interact with Web3, the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and web services.

To learn more, check out the [MEWconnect website][mc].

The MEW wallet app is a great tool you can use to see MEWconnect in action. By pressing a small camera icon on the app, MEW wallet opens your phone’s camera to scan a QR code on MEW web. This QR code is generated by MEWconnect to link the same account from your app to the MEW web interface.

Other platforms can also integrate MEWconnect in order to allow MEW users to connect directly from the MEW wallet app to their preferred platform, such as Aave and Ren - our first integrations.

To learn more about how to use MEWconnect, check out our guide on [how to connect your MEW wallet account to Aave][aave].
