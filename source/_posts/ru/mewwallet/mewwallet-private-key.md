## The MEW wallet app **does not allow** users to export, import, view, or access their private keys.

<br>

**This is for the security of your wallet. Your private key should remain private.**

MEW wallet utilizes [**multi-layer encryption and isolation**](/@@@@@@/mewwallet/mewwallet-security/) to keep your keys safely stored away locally in your device. Your keys are heavily encrypted and completely separate from the outside world.

That means **no one** has access to them, including you.

Instead, the MEW wallet app offers a [**24-word recovery phrase**](/@@@@@@/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/) to back up and restore your wallet. This phrase acts similarly to a private key, so it's important to keep it written down on paper and stored in a physical location.

Don't type your phrase into a word doc. Write it down with a pen!

## **What if I need my private key?**

<br>

It's always considered the best practice to keep your private key off the internet. There are rare cases where a private key is necessary to perform a specific task, like to claim tokens from a specific wallet, but most of the time the compromising nature of exposing your key doesn't make the task worth it.
