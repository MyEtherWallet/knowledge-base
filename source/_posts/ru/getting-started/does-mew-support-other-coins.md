MyEtherWallet (MEW) supports ETH and ERC20 tokens on our main ETH networks.

We also offer support for ETC, Testnet ETH, UBQ, EXP, POA, TOMO, ELLA, ETSC, EGEM, CLO, GO, EOSC, AKA, ESN, PIRL, ETHO, ATH, ILT, WEB, and MUSICOIN. These can be easily accessed through our Network/Node list, after accessing your wallet.

You can use our swap function to swap between BTC and ETH, thanks to our partner Bity, but we do not offer support for BTC. We just offer the option to swap it. This requires you have a BTC wallet, to receive the funds.
