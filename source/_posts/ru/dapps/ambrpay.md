Ambrpay has integrated with MEW to set up and manage recurring payments. This can be utilized in a variety of ways, like setting up subscriptions for services or managing frequent payments to friends, etc.

###### If you’d like to set up a payment system with Ambrpay, you will need a wallet you can [access with our interface](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/). Если у вас нет кошелька, [ нажмите сюда](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/), чтобы его создать.

* Ambrpay pulls your subscription payments from a pool of funds you deposit into the contract. Select how much you’d like to send to this pool.
* Ambrpay takes a 1% fee for this service.
