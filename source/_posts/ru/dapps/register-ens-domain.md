# **ENS: Registering a Domain**

###### {% read_time title "ENS: Registering a Domain" %} min read

* * *

The Ethereum Name Service, also known as ENS, is a domain service that assigns a user-specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address.

ENS domains take the format of `YourDomainHere.eth`. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. There are other use cases as well, but this is the main reason for this service as of right now.

An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:

Normal donation address: `0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D`

ENS donation address: `mewtopia.eth`

Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the ENS domain is much more convenient.

## **How to Register an ENS Domain**

**Step 1.** Head to MyEtherWallet.com.

* Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!

**Step 2.** Access your wallet.

* If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to [create a new wallet](/@@@@@@/Getting_Started/How_To_Create_A_Wallet/). 
* You will also need a small amount of ETH for [gas](/@@@@@@/transactions/what-is-gas/). We generally recommend `.01 ETH` for 1 - 2 transactions. Starting and finalizing ENS auctions both count as a transactions.

**Step 3.** Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet's overview page (or by clicking the ‘Change’ function at the top right).

* Here you will see the ‘ENS Manager’ option. Click there!

**Step 4.** Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.

* ENS domains must be 7 characters or longer.
* Keep in mind that the final product will look like `YourDomainHere.eth`.
* You can also search Etherscan.io for available ENS domains.
* If it says to migrate the ENS domain to the new registrar, that means it is unavailable (unless it's already yours, in which case you should migrate it. All migrations must take place by May 4th, 2020.)

**Step 5.** If your domain is available, you can register it. Select the amount of time you wish to own the domain and click `Register`.

* All domains cost a $5/year equivalent of ETH to maintain. 
* They can be owned indefinitely, as long as this annual fee is paid. 

**Step 6.** After confirming the transaction, your domain request will process for a moment. When it's done, select `Register` again and confirm the second transaction.

**Step 7.** Check your transaction on Etherscan.io. It should show your public address under the 'Owner' field.

**This process will only set your address as the owner of the domain, but you’re not done yet. If you want this domain to point to your address for sending, you still have a bit to do.**

## **Finalizing the Process**

**Step 1.** In order to finish setting up your new domain, search it once again on MyEtherWallet in the ENS Manager Dapp.

**Step 2.** Click 'Manage', and enter the address you'd like all funds to be directed to under the 'Update Resolving address' field. If you'd like it to be the same wallet you've registered on, simply copy and paste the same public address.

**Step 3.** Confirm the transaction, and your domain will be ready to receive funds!

## **Transferring Ownership**

**Step 1.** If you want to transfer ownership of your domain, search it once again on MyEtherWallet in the ENS Manager Dapp.

**Step 2.** Click 'Manage', and enter the address you'd like to transfer the ownership to under the 'Transfer ENS domain to:' field.

**Step 3.** Confirm the transaction, and the ownership of your domain will be transferred.
