# **Pro-Tips: How to Avoid Phishing/Scams**

#### **We’ve compiled a list of tips and tricks to avoid common phishing/scam techniques.**

###### {% read_time title "Pro-Tips: How to Avoid Phishing/Scams" %} min read

**1. Secure your access method.**

-   Whether it's by [purchasing a hardware wallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/hardware-wallet-affiliates), downloading [MEW wallet](/@@@@@@/mewwallet/mewwallet-user-guide/), or by [using MEW offline](/@@@@@@/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/), secure access is the number one defense against phishing.

**2. Install [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn), [PhishFort](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc), or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige).**

-   These Chrome Extensions warn you when visiting malicious sites.

**3. Never click a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company.**

-   Search for the service on Google, and find the information there. (Make sure it’s not an ad!)

**4. You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.**

-   Do not give your private key, [mnemonic phrase](/@@@@@@/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/), or [keystore file](/@@@@@@/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/) to anyone! These are best used with [MEW offline](/@@@@@@/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/).

**5. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting.**

-   Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents over and under the letters.
-   Bookmark all the sites you frequent most!

**6. Always Google search any token sales or ICOs you’re interested in.**

-   If it’s a scam, others will likely be posting about it.
-   Check their Twitter, Reddit, etc. (Follow us on Twitter and Reddit while you’re at it!)

**7. Search smart and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.**

-   Remember, there are many fake bots and accounts out there!

**8. Before sending crypto to any address, search it on Etherscan first.**

-   There is a comment section there that is likely to be full of angry people if the address is known for stealing funds.

**9. Double and triple-check everything!**

-   Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet.
-   While you're at it, register an ENS domain name so your friends can send to "MyName.eth" instead of "0xab3c4edf...".
    -   [Read more about registering a human-readable ENS domain.](/@@@@@@/dapps/register-ens-domain)
-   **We cannot reverse or refund transactions**, so this is very important!

**10. Last, but not least, don't be afraid to ask for help!**
