Digital BitBox Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase [here](https://shiftcrypto.ch/?ref=mew). *Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.*

Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW).

**This part is very important.** Your Digital BitBox device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You cannot import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.

Without further ado, let’s begin!

***

## __The Initial Set-Up__

**Step 1.** Unbox your Digital BitBox! Plug it into your computer and download the [Digital BitBox Desktop App application](https://shiftcrypto.ch/start).
* You may want to pin it to your taskbar.

**Step 2.** In the Digital BitBox Desktop App interface, select 'Create a new wallet'.

**Step 3.** Set up a password to access your Digital BitBox. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it.

**Step 4.** This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need both the SD card AND your choice of recovery password. Do not write this recovery password down on your computer, do not take a picture of the password. Make sure you write down your recovery password in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this password and the SD card it's attached to, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this password down on your computer. Use pen and paper.
* Make sure you remove and take good care of that SD card!

**Step 5.** Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.

***

## __Using Digital BitBox with MEW__

**Step 1.** Attach your Digital BitBox device and head to MyEtherWallet.com.

**Step 2.** On MEW, select 'Access My Wallet' > 'Hardware' > 'Digital BitBox'.

**Step 3.** It will ask for a password. Enter your password to connect to your wallet.

**Step 4.** You will see a bunch of addresses here. Make sure you're on the Ethereum network, using the standard Ethereum derivation path, and then choose your address.
* There's no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it's up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory's sake.

**Step 5.**  You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Digital BitBox hardware wallet!

## __What About My Old Wallet???__

If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure Digital BitBox address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through a regular transaction. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEWconnect, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the Digital BitBox). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new Digital BitBox address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.

Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.

## __How Do I Restore My Digital BitBox to a New Device?__

You will need to use your mini SD card provided **and** the recovery password you chose to recover your wallet.

## __Troubleshooting__

Most issues with the Digital BitBox can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable.
