## <p align="center">Pro-Tips: How to Avoid Phishing/Scams</p>

#### <p align="center">We’ve compiled a list of tips and tricks to avoid common phishing/scam techniques.</p>
***

**1. Install [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn), [PhishFort](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc), or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige).** These Chrome Extensions warn you when visiting malicious sites.

<br>

**2. Never click a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company.** Search for the service on Google, and find the information there. (Make sure it’s not an ad!)

<br>

**3. You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.** Do not give your private key to anyone!

<br>

**4. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting.** Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents. Bookmark all the sites you frequent most!

<br>

**5. Always Google search any token sales or ICOs you’re interested in.** If it’s a scam, others will likely be posting about it. Check their Twitter, Reddit, etc. (Follow us on Twitter and Reddit while you’re at it!)

<br>

**6. Search smart, and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.** Remember, there are many fake bots and accounts out there!

<br>

**7. Before sending crypto to any address, search it on Etherscan first.** There is a comment section there that is likely to be full of angry people if the address is known for stealing funds.

<br>

**8. Double and triple-check everything!** Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet. We cannot reverse or refund transactions, so this is very important!

<br>

**9. Make sure the URL at the top of your interface shows that you are on our correct site, MyEtherWallet.com.** Be cautious of any tiny dots or accents over the letters. Seeing these means you're on a fake site.

<br>

**10. Last, but not least, don't be afraid to ask for help!** We can always be reached at support@myetherwallet.com. Our support team is happy to help with any issue, big or small.
