Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘seed words’ or 'recovery phrases', are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific wallet addresses. These are typically used for recovery, and they are not meant to be used as the main method of access for anyone’s wallet. They can sometimes be paired with a password as well, for added encryption and security. 

Mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key, in terms of privacy. With your phrase, anyone can permanently access your wallet. These phrases cannot be changed, so keeping them safe is crucial.

#### Popular wallets that offer mnemonic phrases for recovery are: 
* MEW! As well as our companion smartphone app, MEWconnect.
* Hardware wallets, such as Ledger Nano S or Trezor.
* MetaMask, JAXX, and various other ETH wallets.

#### Here are some tips for using Mnemonic phrases:
* Use MEW offline!
* Don’t keep the words on a computer, write them down on physical paper.
* Write them down again. And one more time. Keep these lists in easy-to-remember, separate locations.
* Make sure your spelling is 100% correct. Always double-check your work.
* Order is important – the phrase will not work in the wrong sequence.
* Avoid hand-typing your phrase into computers that are connected to the internet.
