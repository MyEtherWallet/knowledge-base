If you’re getting the error code 5, this means that your Ledger is opened and being used by another application, such as Ledger Live. 

## __To fix this error, please follow these steps:__

**Step 1.** Plug in your Ledger device. Make sure that any windows that pop up, including Ledger Live, are closed. 

**Step 2.** Unlock your Ledger device, and navigate to the Ethereum section.

**Step 3.** On MyEtherWallet.com, choose the ‘Access My Wallet’ option.

**Step 4.** Choose the ‘Ledger’ option next, and connect to your device. 

## __If it’s still not connecting, follow these troubleshooting tips:__

* Restart your computer.
* Use Google Chrome.
* Make sure Contract Data is turned ‘On’, under Settings in the Ethereum section of the device.
* Double-check you are confirming any transactions on the device itself.
* Try a different USB cable.
* Upgrade your drivers and firmware.
