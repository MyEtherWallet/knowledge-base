## Buy ETH via Simplex
***

Our partner Simplex allows MEW users to securely buy ETH with a credit card! 



### Here’s how to find it:

**Step 1.** [Access your wallet](). 

**Step 2.** Navigate to the swap section of your wallet. 
* This area is located to the left of your open wallets overview page. 
* If your screen is small, it can be found by clicking the ‘Change’ button in the upper right corner. 

**Step 3.** Click the button in the corner that says ‘Buy ETH with MasterCard/Visa’.

**Step 4.** Follow the prompts to fill in your information.
* You will be redirected to Simplex. 



### A couple things to keep in mind during this process: 

* There is a `$50` minimum and a `$10k` maximum for first purchases.
* Simplex has a daily limit of `$20k`, with a monthly limit of `$50k`. 

If you are having issues with your purchase, Simplex can be reached at support@simplex.com.
