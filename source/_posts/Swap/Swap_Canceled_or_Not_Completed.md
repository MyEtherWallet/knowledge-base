## Swap Was Canceled or Wasn’t Completed
***

Time-constricted transactions can be tough in times of high volume due to various factors, like the transaction queue, ongoing token sales, the current state of the network, etc.

If you sent coins or tokens to the specified swap address, but have not received your funds in return, please reach out to both support@myetherwallet.com and whichever exchange you completed the swap through. Their support emails are:

* Bity - mew@bity.com

* Kyber Network - support@kyber.network 

* Changelly - 

We recommend going back to our swap section and clicking the ‘Issue with your Swap? Contact support.’ link at the bottom of the page. Or, click [here]().

This will autofill all the information we need to resolve your claim, including:

* REF ID#:

* Amount to send:

* Amount to receive:

* Payment Address:

* Receiving Address:

If you do not include this information, we can still help. But having that from the beginning really helps to speed up the process.
