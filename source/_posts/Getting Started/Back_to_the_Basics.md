***

### 1. Check the URL to make sure it says ‘MyEtherWallet.com’.
* Keep us bookmarked for future use.
* Phishers are tricky, so make sure there are no dots or accents on any of the letters.
* If you find a phishing site, send it to us so we can take it down!
* Download [EAL](), [PhishFort](), or [Cryptonite]() for up-to-date alerts when visiting known phishing sites.

### 2. Use the checksummed version of your address.
* This is the version of your address that includes both capital and lowercase letters.
* For more information on checksummed addresses, click [here]().

<br>

### 3. Send a small amount first, to test the waters.
* We cannot reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Make sure you know the process inside and out!
* Learn more about sending transactions [here]().

<br>

### 4. Keep your information off the computer.
* Write down everything in physical backups.
* Pen and paper is highly underrated. No one can hack your notebook!
* However, you can lose your notebook – so make extra copies.
* [Use MEW offline]() for extra security!

<br>

### 5. Do not share your private information with anyone.
* Including us! We will never ask for your private key.

<br>

### 6. We will never email you first.
* If you got an email from us without emailing us first, it’s not us.

<br>

### 7. Google can be your best friend or your worst enemy.
* Do your research, and remain skeptical!
* Before sending to a third-party or using a new service, Google the service name + ‘scam’ or ‘reviews’.

<br>

### 8. Pay very close attention to address entry.
* Sending to a wrong address can mean the permanent loss of your funds. Make sure you know who you’re sending to.
* Double and triple check everything. Even one wrong character will make a difference and lead to loss of funds.
* Never hand type anything. Copy & paste is your best friend!

<br>

### 9. Buy a hardware wallet.
* Hardware wallets are generally around ~100 USD and offer the best protection for your crypto assets. So mathematically, if you have more than 200 USD in crypto, there is no excuse not to get one!
* [Ledger]() and [Trezor]() are two great options we highly recommend!

<br>

### 10. Ask for help.
* This is still a very new field, but it has a strong community to back it up.
* Social media platforms like [Reddit]() and [Twitter]() are filled with real people who live and breathe crypto, ourselves included!
* Reach out to our support team directly if you’re ever confused or have concerns. We can be reached at support@myetherwallet.com.
