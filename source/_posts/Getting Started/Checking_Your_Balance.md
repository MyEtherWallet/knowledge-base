## Checking Your Balance
***

It is not recommended to unlock your wallet every time you’d like to check your balance, for the security of your information. Instead, you can see all balances and transaction history through the use of an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) or [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io). To check your balance, all you need is your public Ethereum address. This is 42 characters long and begins with an ‘0x….’.

Be aware that when checking ETC balances, you should use an Ethereum Classic blockchain explorer instead, such as Gastracker.io.



### Etherscan

**Step 1.** Head to [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io). 

**Step 2.** In the search bar, enter your Ethereum public address, (0x…..).

**Step 3.** You will be taken to a wallet overview. 
* At the top, you will see the checksummed version of your address. To learn about the difference between checksummed and non-checksummed addresses, click [here]().
* In the ‘Overview’ section, you will see your ETH balance and value.
* Under ‘Misc:’, you can find your Token Balances. When looking for custom token information, this is where you can select a specific token to find its contract address, decimal count, and symbol. To learn more about adding custom tokens to MEW, click [here]().
* The tabs at the bottom of the screen show the history of ETH, ERC20 token, and ERC721 token transactions.



### Ethplorer

**Step 1.** Head to [Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io).

**Step 2.** In the search bar, enter your Ethereum public address, (0x…..).

**Step 3.** You will be taken to a wallet overview.

* To the left, you will see the checksummed version of your address. To learn about the difference between checksummed and non-checksummed addresses, click [here]().
* You can also find your ETH balance to the left, under ‘Address Information’.
* To the right, you can find your Token Balances. When looking for custom token information, this is where you can select a specific token to find its contract address, decimal count, and symbol. To learn more about adding custom tokens to MEW, click [here]().
* The bottom of the screen shows the history of ETH, ERC20 token, and ERC721 token transactions. You can apply filters if you want to see just ETH or tokens, using tick marks at the top.
