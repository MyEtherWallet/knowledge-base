## How to Send a Transaction
***

MyEtherWallet (MEW) makes it easy for you to send a transaction. All you need is a wallet, the Ethereum address you’d like to send funds to, and a little ETH for gas. 

If you plan to move large amounts of ETH or ERC20 tokens, we suggest sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes as planned. 

**Step 1.** [Access your wallet](). 

**Step 2.** Your wallet should automatically be opened on the ‘Send Transaction’ screen. If it’s not, you can find this area to the left of your wallet overview page.

**Step 3.** Fill in the type of currency you’d like to send, the amount, and the address you’d like to send to. 
* Make sure to double and triple check the address you’re sending to! We cannot recover funds sent to the wrong address.
* When sending your entire balance of ETH, choose the ‘Send Entire Balance’ option, so your gas is auto-calculated out of the total. 
* Gas and gas limit will auto-generate based on network congestion.
* If you don’t see the token you’d like to send, you may need to [add it as a custom token]().

**Step 4.** Click ‘Send Transaction’ and confirm the transaction on the next screen.
* If you’re using MEWconnect or a hardware wallet, be sure to confirm the transaction on your device as well.

**Step 5.** Your transaction has been posted! Copy your transaction hash, for your records. 
* Check your transaction hash on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) to make sure everything went through properly.
