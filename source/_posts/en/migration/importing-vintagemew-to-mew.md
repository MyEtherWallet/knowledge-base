As of October 20th, 2019 we have discontinued our VintageMEW site. 

If you are like many of our other users, you may be wondering how this will affect your wallet. 

Fear not! MyEtherWallet (MEW) is still going strong at our current site, [www.myetherwallet.com][mewsite].

Here you are able to access the same wallet you used on the Vintage version of our site, through the same method.

First, select ‘Access My Wallet’ on the homepage.

Then choose your usual method of access. For example, if you used a Keystore/JSON file on vintage you’d select ‘Software’ and choose the ‘Keystore’ option to connect.

After you’ve connected, you’ll be taken to your Wallet Dashboard page. Here you can view your balances, send transactions, interact with Dapps, swap your crypto, and even manage NFTs! 

We’ve come a long way since our days in Vintage, so it’s a good idea to take a few minutes and explore our new features. 

For more information, check out our guide on [how to access your wallet][accessmew]!
