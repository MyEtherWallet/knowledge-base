**Step 1.** Access your wallet and head to the ‘Contracts’ section, to the left of your wallet interface.

**Step 2.** Locate your preferred Multisig Contract ABI in the dropdown, or manually enter the contract's ABI. 

**Step 3.** Check the contract address to make sure it's the one you're looking for, then press 'Continue'. 
* You may need to enter your contract address in the ‘Contract Address’ field at the top. 

**Step 4.** Select ‘Execute’ from the dropdown menu. 
* Enter the address you want to send to in the `_To` field.
* Enter the amount you want to send in the `_Value` field. 
* In the `Data` field, type `0x`. This sets it to empty. 
* Leave the `Value in ETH` as `0`.
* Click `Write`.
* Confirm the transaction and send. 

**Step 5.** Click the Transaction ID that outputs with the ‘Success’ message. Copy this ID.

**Step 6.** If it’s a multisig contract with two owners, you will need to refresh this page and choose ‘Confirm’.
* In Step 5, you opened the Transaction ID from the ‘Execute’ call. You should have a page like [this][exampleTX] open.
* Click the ‘Event Logs’ tab.
* For reference, at [this][referenceLog] link (note this is not YOUR link, it’s an example), the `_h` value would be `9228aeaf3ed560274899483646ea4ce9b322bccffac60cac2d035d08752617f4`.
* Check the link above where it says that string, and then compare it to find what YOUR `_h` value is. It will be different than what we provided as an example. 
* Go back to MEW, where you have the ‘Confirm’ page open, and paste your string into the `_h` field.
* Click ‘Write’ again and unlock the second owner’s account. 
* Generate and send the transaction.

**Step 7.** Double-check to confirm everything went as intended.

**Step 8.** If your multisig is a 3 of 5 multisig, you will repeat the confirm process outlined in Step 6 until it reaches the necessary approvals. Luckily, the `_h` value will remain the same for each of them.

**Step 9.** You can view another approval for our previous example [here][eventLog].

**Step 10.** Feel free to repeat this process whenever you want to send ETH.
