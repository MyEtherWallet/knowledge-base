MyEtherWallet (MEW) is an open-source platform, meaning we believe in transparency and offer our code freely to all who choose to view it, via GitHub. 

This also means that we are always ready and willing to accept community support, through the use of pull requests. To make a pull request for MEW, you need only follow a simple process.



## __Submit a Pull Request__

**Step 1.** Login or join [GitHub][gitHub]. 

**Step 2.** Navigate to the file you wish to modify.

**Step 3.** Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner.

**Step 4.** Make the changes you wish to see reflected on MEW.

**Step 5.** At the bottom of the same screen, type a short message explaining what you changed and why in the title box. 

**Step 6.** Click the green ‘Propose File Change’ button.

**Step 7.** Click ‘Create Pull Request’, twice.

**Step 8.** Celebrate, you’re done! We will review the changes made and include them with our next release, if everything looks good.
