# **Move Your Bitcoin to Ethereum using the MEW wallet app**

MEW wallet has partnered with RenVM to offer a Bitcoin bridge to Ethereum right in the MEW wallet app. Now users can hold their BTC with MEW wallet in the form of renBTC, which is a token that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and is pegged to BTC’s value. This token can be swapped for other tokens or moved back to BTC at any time.

To begin, you’ll need an active Bitcoin wallet with BTC and a MEW wallet app account. 

### **Moving Bitcoin to Ethereum**

<br>

**Step 1.** When you’re ready, head to the MEW wallet app.

**Step 2.** Tap the double-sided arrow in the bottom row to go to the ‘Swap’ section, then select ‘Move Bitcoin to Ethereum’.

**Step 3.** You will be given a temporary ‘Deposit Address’ for BTC that will last for 12 hours. Send the designated amount of BTC to this temporary address in order to begin the process of moving it to your MEW wallet account.

**Step 4.** Once the deposit has been detected, there will be a process of 6 confirmations to confirm the deposit. This process will take a while. 

**Step 5.** After the 6 confirmations are completed, your renBTC will be minted and sent directly to your MEW wallet account address.

**Step 6.** You’re done! Once you’ve received your renBTC, you can begin swapping it for other tokens, using it in DeFi apps, or you can just hold onto it.

### **Moving Back to Bitcoin**

<br>

**Step 1.** When you’re ready to move back to Bitcoin, head to the MEW wallet app.

**Step 2.** Tap the double-sided arrow in the bottom row to go to the ‘Swap’ section, then select ‘Move Bitcoin to Ethereum’.

**Step 3.** From here, select 'Move back to BTC'.

**Step 4.** Enter the amount of renBTC you'd like to send back, then continue.

</div>

**Step 5.** Set your BTC deposit address, select 'Proceed with move', and your transfer back to BTC will begin. 

**Step 6.** After a few confirmations, your BTC transfer will complete, and you'll be all set! This process may take a while.

## **Risks Involved:**

- When you begin this process, make sure you send your Bitcoin within the 12 hour time limit and use a high gas fee. If the Bitcoin transaction and 6 confirmations don’t go through in 24 hours, the Bitcoin can get stuck. Most of the time, Ren will be able to recover it for you, but in rare edge-cases, this Bitcoin could be permanently lost.
- Don't send your Bitcoin directly from a centralized exchange. Most centralized exchanges pool many different users together under a few addresses. If something goes wrong with the process, and your BTC is sent back to you, an exchange may have trouble knowing this BTC is meant for you. 
-   If you send an amount of BTC that is too small, it will all be used up in the fees for this process, so make sure you send a substantial amount. 
-   This transferral process is built by RenVM, so it’s important to do your research into the risks associated with their platform and product. Also, all value for renBTC is protected by RenVM, but if something happens to RenVM, we cannot guarantee the BTC peg for renBTC.

#### **Here is a breakdown of the fees involved, which are also displayed during the transferral process:**

-   1% MEW service fee
-   0.1% RenVM network fee
-   0.000007 BTC as a flat gas fee by RenVM (which can increase during times of high volume)
-   Ethereum gas fee, determined by network congestion
