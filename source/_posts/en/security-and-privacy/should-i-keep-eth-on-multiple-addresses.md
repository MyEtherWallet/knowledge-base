MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a front-end interface that enables direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. Any Ethereum address (0xâ€¦.) can hold both ETH and ERC20 tokens. MEW allows users to manage a variety of different funds on a single address.

Many exchanges will give separate addresses for separate tokens, but this is not necessary on MEW. Whether you store all your funds on one address or spread your crypto portfolio across multiple addresses is ultimately up to you. 

Some users prefer to have their funds distributed across multiple addresses for the purposes of security, organization, or personal preference. Others find that keeping track of one wallet is easier. We suggest using whichever method best fits your needs.

However, remember that all Ethereum blockchain transactions require gas, which is always paid in ETH. We recommend having at least .01 ETH on all your addresses, for sending transactions when needed. Also, make sure to keep all your information organized. The more addresses you have, the easier it can be to lose track and forget essential details about your wallets.
