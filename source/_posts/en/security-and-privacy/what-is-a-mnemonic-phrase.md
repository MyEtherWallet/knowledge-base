Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘seed words’ or 'recovery phrases', are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific wallet addresses. These are typically used for recovery, and they are not meant to be used as the main method of access for anyone’s wallet. These phrases offer direct access to one's wallet, so they should be treated carefully.

They can sometimes be paired with an extra word as well, for added encryption and security. When wallets offer this service, the extra word is used as an extra added word to the end of the phrase. For example, 12-word phrases become 13 words, and 24-word phrases become 25 words. MyEtherWallet offers this service, but MEW wallet does not. This means that mnemonic phrases generated directly on MEW's website will have the option for an extra word at the end. But if you are restoring a MEWconnect recovery phrase on the web interface, you should leave the extra word field blank. 

Mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key, in terms of privacy. With your phrase, anyone can permanently access your wallet. These phrases cannot be changed, so keeping them safe is crucial. 

## **Popular wallets that offer mnemonic phrases for recovery are:**

-   MEW! As well as our companion smartphone app, MEW wallet.
-   Hardware wallets, such as Ledger Nano S or Trezor.
-   MetaMask, JAXX, and various other ETH wallets.

## **Here are some tips for using Mnemonic phrases:**

-   [Use MEW offline][mewoffline]!
-   Don’t keep the words on a computer, write them down on physical paper.
-   Write them down again. And one more time. Keep these lists in easy-to-remember, separate locations.
-   Make sure your spelling is 100% correct. Always double-check your work.
-   Order is important – the phrase will not work in the wrong sequence.
-   Avoid hand-typing your phrase into computers that are connected to the internet.

## **My phrase brings me to unfamiliar addresses. Why?**

-   Think back to where you first created the wallet. Did the service require an extra word (13th or 25th word)?
    -   If it did, try entering your mnemonic phrase with the extra word you made.
    -   If you already tried that, try entering the phrase leaving the extra word field blank.
-   If neither of these options worked, double-check the order and spelling of all words.
-   If you're still stuck, reach out to our support team. We're always happy to help.
