**1. Secure your access method.** 
* Whether it's by [purchasing a hardware wallet][hwallet], downloading [MEWconnect][mewconnect], or by [using MEW offline][MEWoffline], secure access is the number one defense against phishing.

**2. Install [EAL][EAL], [PhishFort][PhishFort], or [Cryptonite][Cryptonite].**
* These Chrome Extensions warn you when visiting malicious sites.


**3. Never click a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company.** 
* Search for the service on Google, and find the information there. (Make sure it’s not an ad!)

**4. You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.** 
* Do not give your private key, [mnemonic phrase][phrase], or [keystore file][keystore] to anyone! These are best used with [MEW offline][MEWoffline].


**5. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting.** 
* Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents over and under the letters. 
* Bookmark all the sites you frequent most!

**6. Always Google search any token sales or ICOs you’re interested in.** 
* If it’s a scam, others will likely be posting about it. 
* Check their Twitter, Reddit, etc. (Follow us on Twitter and Reddit while you’re at it!)

**7. Search smart and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.** 
* Remember, there are many fake bots and accounts out there!

**8. Before sending crypto to any address, search it on Etherscan first.** 
* There is a comment section there that is likely to be full of angry people if the address is known for stealing funds.

**9. Double and triple-check everything!** 
* Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet. 
* While you're at it, register an ENS domain name so your friends can send to "MyName.eth" instead of "0xab3c4edf...".
    * [Read more about registering a human-readable ENS domain.][ens]
* **We cannot reverse or refund transactions**, so this is very important!


**10. Last, but not least, don't be afraid to ask for help!** 
* We can always be reached at support@myetherwallet.com. 
* Our support team is happy to help with any issue, big or small.
