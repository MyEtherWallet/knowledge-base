MEW CX allows users to have the entirety of MEW in a bite-sized Chrome Extension accessible from their toolbar. Create and manage your wallets, interact with DApps, and send transactions quick using our QuickSend feature.

To learn more about MEW CX and what it has to offer, check out our Medium post. 

## __Installing MEW CX__

**Step 1.** On Google Chrome, head to [this link][mewcx]. Then select ‘Add to Chrome’. 

* To avoid downloading a fake client, double-check the provider for MyEtherWallet Inc, and check the rating / number of users.

* Google Chrome will require you to accept permissions. For more information on what these mean, check out [this article][chromearticle]. Rest assured that MEW will never store or share any of your data. This permission is necessary for checking URLs for known phishing sites, or interacting with a DApp on another website.

**Step 2.** After you’ve installed MEW CX, click the MEW icon in your toolbar. A pop-up will appear asking you to add a wallet. Click there.

**Step 3.** Choose how you’d like to access your wallet, or generate a new one. And you’re done!

* For more information on access methods, check out our [KB article][access] on the subject.

Your wallet will remain saved in the Chrome Extension until you remove the wallet or the extension. Remember, it’s always best to keep your wallet information on physical paper somewhere safe and easy to remember, in case anything happens to your device.
