###### If you’d like to open a Vault using our MakerDAO Dapp, you will need a wallet you can [access with our interface][access]. If you do not have a wallet, [click here][create] to set one up.

## **Opening Your Vault**

**Step 1.** Unlock your wallet on our site by selecting ‘Access My Wallet’, then choosing the method of access you prefer.

**Step 2.** Head to our Dapps section to the left of your Wallet Overview page, then select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 3.** Select 'Create a Vault' to get started.

-   If you've set up a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) in the past, you will need to follow the processes outlined under "Upgrade 'old' DAI to 'new' DAI" and "Migrate Single Collateral CDP to Multi Collateral Vault".

**Step 4.** Set the amount of ETH you would like to offer as collateral. Remember to leave some wiggle room to account for the shifting markets. 200% and above is usually a safe bet.

-   Before you generate your vault, you'll need to select 'Create Proxy'. 
-   Make sure to confirm the transactions on your device, if you're using one.

**Step 2.** Choose 'Set' to set allowance for Maker to interact with your DAI. 

-   You will need to 'Deploy Proxy' if it's your first time. Select 'Setup' in the top area of this section.

## **Closing Your Vault**

**Step 1.** When you’re ready, head back to the Dapps section and select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 2.** Click ‘Manage Your Vault’ to see your holdings.

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/MKR9.png" width="100%">

**Step 3.** You will need to pay your DAI back in order to withdraw your ETH. Under 'DAI Position', select 'Pay back >'. 

-   You will have to ‘Approve’ the DAI amount in order to pay it back, which will count as a separate transaction.
-   Please wait for both transactions to post as 'Success' before continuing.

**Step 5.** Your vault doesn't actually _close_, but remains empty and ready should you ever need to use it again.
