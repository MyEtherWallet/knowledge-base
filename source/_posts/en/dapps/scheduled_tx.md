**Step 1.** [Access your wallet][access].

**Step 2.** Head to the Dapps page on your Wallet Dashboard.

-   Fill in the ‘To Address’ with the final address you’d like the payment to be delivered to.
-   Set a Date & Time when you’d like the transaction to post, and make sure you’re using the correct timezone.
