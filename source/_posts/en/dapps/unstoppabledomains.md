# **Buy a .crypto Domain with Unstoppable Domains**

Unstoppable Domains is a service that assigns a user-specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address. 

Unstoppable Domains take the format of `YourDomainHere.crypto`. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. 

An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:

Normal donation address: `0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D`

.crypto donation address: `mewtopia.crypto`

Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the Unstoppable Domain version is much more convenient.

## **How to Register an Unstoppable Domain**

**Step 1.** Head to MyEtherWallet.com.

-   Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!

**Step 2.** Access your wallet. 

-   If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to [create a new wallet][createWallet]. 
-   You will also need $40 worth of ETH for the domain, and a small amount of ETH for [gas][gas]. We generally recommend `.01 ETH` for 1 - 2 transactions.

**Step 3.** Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet's overview page. It can also be found at the bottom of the page, under the 'Dapps' section. 

-   Here you will see the ‘Unstoppable Domains’ option. Click there!

**Step 4.** Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.

-   Unstoppable Domains must be 6 characters or longer.
-   Keep in mind that the final product will look like `YourDomainHere.crypto`.

**Step 5.** If your domain is available, you can buy it for $40 by clicking 'Buy'. 

-   Unstoppable Domains allows you to purchase the domain with fiat through a Credit Card, if you want to. This process is handled by a third party service called Stripe.

**Step 6.** After confirming the transaction, your domain request will process for a moment. When it's done, you will be redirected to a page that tells you to wait around 5 - 10 minutes.

**Step 7.** After the processing is completed, you're done! Your new domain will be transferred to the wallet you used to purchase it.

**This process will set your address as the owner of the domain. To view more information about your domain, you'll need to set up an account at [the Unstoppable Domains website][ud], or search your new .crypto domain on their homepage.**
