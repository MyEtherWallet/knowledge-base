###### If you'd like to upload your very own decentralized website to an ENS or Unstoppable Domain, you will first need to purchase a domain name.

###### To purchase a .eth domain, you can use the [Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) Manager][ens] from our Dapps section on MEW web. If you're interested in a .crypto domain, you can use the [Unstoppable Domain Manager][ud] from the same Dapp section.

###### You will also need either a ZIP file of your website or the IPFS hash.

## **How to Set Up your Decentralized Website with an ENS Domain**

**Step 1.** [Access your wallet.][access]

-   Make sure your wallet has a .eth domain attached to the public address.

**Step 2.** Head to the 'Dapps' section, and select the ENS Manager.

**Step 5.** If you have a ZIP file, click 'Upload your website' and select the file. Otherwise, paste your IPFS hash directly into the box.

**Step 6.** Select 'Set IPFS Hash'.

-   You will need to confirm some transactions. If you're using a device to access your wallet, remember you may need to confirm the transaction on your device.

**Step 7.** Your web content will process. Once your transaction posts, your website will be ready! 

-   It will take some time for your website to upload. 
-   You may need to refresh the MEW web interface to see your IPFS set.

**Step 8.** You're done! Your website is now viewable by using your .eth domain name with MetaMask or the Unstoppable Domains browser extension, or by adding .link to the end of it on your normal browser (i.e. myfavoritewallet.eth.link).
