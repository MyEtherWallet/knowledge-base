Have you accidentally sent ETC to your ETH address? Are you curious to try ETH, but want to fool around on the Ropsten test network first? Or maybe you’re just interested in other networks that have forked off of the Ethereum blockchain? If any of the above are true, this is the article for you.



## __Using MEWconnect, MetaMask, or a Keystore File/Mnemonic Phrase/Private Key__

**Step 1.** [Access your wallet][accessMEW] by choosing the desired method of access.

* We do not recommend using a Keystore File/Mnemonic Phrase/Private Key to access your funds. If you use one of these methods, we highly suggest [using MEW offline][offlineMEW], or [creating a new wallet with MEWconnect][createMEWconnect] and transferring your funds. 

**Step 2.** On your wallet’s overview page, you will see a ‘Network’ section in the upper right hand corner. Click the 'Change' button.

**Step 3.** Choose the network you would like to interact with from this list. Your address will not change, but your funds will change to reflect the selected network. 
* If you see multiple networks for your choice (i.e. ETC), there is no need to overthink it. Just choose whichever one you’d like, and change it to another if it seems slow or congested! 



## __Using a Hardware Wallet__

**Step 1.** Access your wallet using the ‘Hardware’ option. 

**Step 2.** Choose the network you would like to connect to, followed by the derivation path desired.

* You will notice there are separate derivation paths for ETC and ETH. You do not have to change to the ETC path in order to access your ETC. Changing the derivation path will produce a different list of Ethereum addresses than you may be used to seeing. Simply change the network to ETC, and feel free to access your familiar ETH address through the ETH derivation path. 

**Step 3.** Connect with your device, and you’re done! You will be directed to your wallet’s overview page on the desired network.
