## __1. Create a Wallet__
**Step 1.** Open your MEWconnect app.

**Step 2.** Click "Create New Wallet".

**Step 3.** Pick a strong password.

This step is very important. Make sure you pick a password that is not easy to guess, but also write it down with pen and paper. If you forget it, we cannot recover it for you. There is only one other way 
to access your wallet, and we’ll get to that soon.

**Step 4.** Type it again.

**Step 5.** Click "Start using MEWconnect".

You’re done! You’ll be taken to a screen that shows your new wallets address backed by a unique color-code. On this screen you’ll find all your ETH and ERC20 tokens. There is also a handy ‘Share’ button next to your address, in case you want to send it to someone.

## __2. Back it up__
**Step 1.** Select "Back Up" on your wallets homepage.

**Step 2.** Click "Back Up Now".

**Step 3.** Get a pen and paper ready. Then press ‘Start’.

**Step 4.** Enter in your password to verify you’re you.

**Step 5.** WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED WORDS.

This is the single most important piece of information about your wallet. These 24 words will decide the future of your funds. Do not lose them, and do not screenshot them.

**Step 6.**  Pass the seed word check test.

You're done! All backed up and ready to connect to MEW
