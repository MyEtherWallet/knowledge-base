# __Back to the Basics: 10 Tips for Beginners__
###### ⏰ 3 min read

## __1. Check the URL to make sure it says ‘MyEtherWallet.com’.__
* Keep us bookmarked for future use.
* Phishers are tricky, so make sure there are no dots or accents on any of the letters.
* If you find a phishing site, send it to us so we can take it down!
* Download [EAL][EAL], [PhishFort][PhishFort], or [Cryptonite][Cryptonite] for up-to-date alerts when visiting known phishing sites.



## __2. Use the checksummed version of your address.__
* This is the version of your address that includes both capital and lowercase letters.
* For more information on checksummed addresses, click [here][checksum].



## __3. Send a small amount first, to test the waters.__
* We cannot reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Make sure you know the process inside and out!
* Learn more about sending transactions [here][checksum].



## __4. Keep your information off the computer.__
* Write down everything in physical backups.
* Pen and paper is highly underrated. No one can hack your notebook!
* However, you can lose your notebook – so make extra copies.
* [Use MEW offline][offline] for extra security!



## __5. Do not share your private information with anyone.__
* Including us! We will never ask for your private key.



## __6. We will never email you first.__
* If you got an email from us without emailing us first, it’s not us.



## __7. Google can be your best friend or your worst enemy.__
* Do your research, and remain skeptical!
* Before sending to a third-party or using a new service, Google the service name + ‘scam’ or ‘reviews’.



## __8. Pay very close attention to address entry.__
* Sending to a wrong address can mean the permanent loss of your funds. Make sure you know who you’re sending to.
* Double and triple check everything. Even one wrong character will make a difference and lead to loss of funds.
* Never hand type anything. Copy & paste is your best friend!



## __9. Buy a hardware wallet.__
* Hardware wallets are generally around ~100 USD and offer the best protection for your crypto assets. So mathematically, if you have more than 200 USD in crypto, there is no excuse not to get one!
* [Ledger][ledger] and [Trezor][trezor] are two great options we highly recommend!



## __10. Ask for help.__
* This is still a very new field, but it has a strong community to back it up.
* Social media platforms like [Reddit][reddit] and [Twitter][twitter] are filled with real people who live and breathe crypto, ourselves included!
* Reach out to our support team directly if you’re ever confused or have concerns. We can be reached at support@myetherwallet.com.
