# __How to Change Your Password on MEWconnect__
***

To change your password on MEWconnect, all you need is your phone and your 24-word recovery phrase. 

If you still remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, please read this article on [how to backup your wallet]() (found in section 2). Resetting your wallet without knowing your recovery phrase will result in the permanent loss of your wallet.

If you do not remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, there is nothing we can do. Retrace your steps and try to remember your password, or your wallet will be lost forever. 



## __Change Your Password__

**Step 1.** Reset your wallet, either on the login screen or under our ‘Info’ section. 
* Choose ‘Forgot password?’ on the home screen, or ‘Reset wallet >’ in the Info tab.

**Step 2.** Enter your 24-word recovery phrase. Make sure each word is in the correct order and spelled accurately. 
* Do not include commas between the words, only a single space.

**Step 3.** Enter a new password. Please choose a difficult one, for increased security. 
* Be sure to write this password down somewhere, so you don’t forget it! 
* We cannot recover or change your password for you.
