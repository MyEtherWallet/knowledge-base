Time-constricted transactions can be tough in times of high volume due to various factors, like the transaction queue, ongoing token sales, the current state of the network, etc.

If you sent coins or tokens to the specified swap address, but have not received your funds in return, please reach out to both [support@myetherwallet.com](mailto:support@myetherwallet.com) and whichever exchange you completed the swap through. Their support emails are:

-   Bity - Their help center is integrated into their site.

-   Kyber Network - [support@kyber.network](mailto:support@kyber.network)

-   Changelly - [support@changelly.com](mailto:support@changelly.com)
