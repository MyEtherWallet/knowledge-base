Ambrpay has integrated with MEW to set up and manage recurring payments. This can be utilized in a variety of ways, like setting up subscriptions for services or managing frequent payments to friends, etc.

###### If you’d like to set up a payment system with Ambrpay, you will need a wallet you can [access with our interface](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/). If you do not have a wallet, [click here](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/) to set one up.

## **Using Ambrpay with MEW**

**Step 1.** Access your wallet.

-   Choose your preferred method of access.

**Step 3**. Add funds to your balance by selecting 'Add Funds'.

-   Ambrpay pulls your subscription payments from a pool of funds you deposit into the contract. Select how much you’d like to send to this pool.
-   Ambrpay takes a 1% fee for this service.

###### After your subscription is set up, you can cancel it at any time through the ‘My Subscriptions’ section.

###### You can also ‘Withdraw Funds’ from the contract, found in the same area as ‘Add Funds’.
