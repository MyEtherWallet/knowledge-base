# __Using MakerDAO__
###### {% read_time title "Using MakerDAO" %} min read

###### If you’d like to open a Vault using our MakerDAO Dapp, you will need a wallet you can [access with our interface](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/). If you do not have a wallet, [click here](/@@@@@@/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/) to set one up.


## __Opening Your Vault__

**Step 1.** Unlock your wallet on our site by selecting ‘Access My Wallet’, then choosing the method of access you prefer.

**Step 2.** Head to our Dapps section to the left of your Wallet Overview page, then select ‘MakerDAO’.

**Step 3.** Select 'Create a Vault' to get started.
* If you've set up a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) in the past, you will need to follow the processes outlined under "Upgrade 'old' DAI to 'new' DAI" and "Migrate Single Collateral CDP to Multi Collateral Vault".

**Step 4.** Set the amount of ETH you would like to offer as collateral. Remember to leave some wiggle room to account for the shifting markets. 200% and above is usually a safe bet.
* You will need to confirm the transaction on your device, if you're using one.

## __Earning Interest With DAI__

**Step 1.** Head to the MakerDAO Dapp page and select 'DAI Savings'.

**Step 2.** Choose 'Set' to set allowance for Maker to interact with your DAI.
* You will need to 'Deploy Proxy' if it's your first time. Select 'Setup' in the top area of this section.

**Step 3.** Choose how much DAI you'd like to deposit. Interest rates are accrued annually.

**Step 4.** To withdraw, you can follow the same procedure, but select 'Withdraw'.

## __Closing Your Vault__

**Step 2.** Click ‘Manage Your Vault’ to see your holdings.

**Step 3.** You will need to pay your DAI back in order to withdraw your ETH. Under 'DAI Position', select 'Pay back >'.
* You will have to ‘Approve’ the DAI amount in order to pay it back.
* This will count as separate transactions.
* Please wait for each transaction to post as 'Success' before continuing.

**Step 5.** Your vault doesn't actually *close*, but remains empty and ready should you ever need to use it again.
