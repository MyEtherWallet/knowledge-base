BC Vault Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase [here](https://bc-vault.com/?wpam_id=53).

_Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure._

Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW).

**This part is very important.** Your BC Vault device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.

Without further ado, let’s begin!

## **The Initial Set-Up**

**Step 1.** Unbox your BC Vault! Plug it into your computer and download the [BC Vault Desktop Application](https://bc-vault.com/#downloader).

-   You may want to pin it to your taskbar.

**Step 2.** Open the BC Vault Desktop Application and look to your device. The first time you set-up your device, you will need to shake it to initialize the random number generation. Once you're done, the device should connect.

**Step 3.** The BC Vault desktop application will take you through a set-up tutorial for your Global Password. Make sure you pay close attention to the information shown. A few key things to remember:

-   Read extra tips. This is your money, and it's your responsibility.
-   Nobody can recover or change this information for you, so you need to remember it. Write it down and store it somewhere safe.

**Step 4.** Once you're done, you will see a screen to create your first wallet. Before you do that, head to the settings section in the top-right. Familiarize yourself with this section and change any settings for your comfort. You can also update your firmware here.

**Step 5.** It's extremely important you back up your wallet through the Settings section. You can use an SD card or a series of QR codes, whichever you're more comfortable with. Just don't lose it!

**Step 6.** When you're ready, head back to the main screen and select 'Add New Wallet'. Choose Ethereum, name it, and continue to set up your new wallet.

**Step 7.** You're done! You've now created a new wallet with BC Vault.

## **Using BC Vault with MEW**

**Step 1.** Attach your BC Vault device and head to MyEtherWallet.com.

**Step 2.** On MEW, select 'Access My Wallet' > 'Hardware' > 'BC Vault'.

**Step 3.** It will ask for a Global Password on the website and a Pin on the device. Enter your information to connect to your wallet.

**Step 4.** Select the address you want to use with MEW.

**Step 5.**  You should now be taken to a screen that shows your new wallet address on MEW. Great job! You’re officially using your new BC Vault hardware wallet!

## **What About My Old Wallet???**

If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure BC Vault address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the BC Vault). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new BC Vault address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.

Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.

## **How Do I Restore My BC Vault to a New Device?**

You will need to use either the SD card that was backed up with your BC Vault wallet, or the QR codes that were printed out, to restore your device.

## **Troubleshooting**

Most issues with the BC Vault can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable.
