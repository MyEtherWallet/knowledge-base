## **Back Up Your Account**

#### **This step is crucial if you plan on using your wallet in the long term. We cannot recover your account for you, so you must keep track of this information yourself.**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Step 1.** After creating your wallet, select 'Back up Now'. Read the warning and continue.

-   You can also head to ‘Settings’, then ‘View my recovery phrase’.

**Step 2.** Get a pen and a piece of paper, then write down the 24 words that appear.

-   Keep these words in the same order as they appear, and double-check that it’s all spelled correctly.
-   Ideally, you should write this phrase down 2 - 3 times on separate sheets of paper, stored in multiple secure locations.
-   We cannot recover this phrase for you, and anyone that has access to it will have permanent access to your funds.
