You can now use MEW as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing access to a faster and more stable version of our site directly from a shortcut on your desktop. 

To make use of this feature, you first need to be on a supported browser (Chrome and Brave are MEW-recommended browsers).

Head to our web page and check in your browser settings for the option “Install MyEtherWallet…”

This will install the website to your computer as a PWA shortcut, making it available for easy access and providing an improved user experience.
